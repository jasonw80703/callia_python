# Review from last week
# ======
# Variables
# Please create a variable named xyz, that holds the value 100
xyz = 100
# print(xyz)
cwt = "Callia"
a = 10
b = a

# String Joining
# print("Hello, my name is " + cwt + '.')

# This week
# =========
# Booleans (bool)
# There are two type of booleans: True and False
# print(True)
# print(False)

# Operators

# These four operators always return a number
# 5+3 (add) returns a number
# 5*3 (multiply) returns a number
# 10/2 (divide) returns a number (as a decimal)
# 5-3 (minus or subtract) returns a number

# 5==5 (equals) returns a boolean (True if they are equal, False if they are not equal)
# Numbers:
# a = 2 * 3
# print(5==a)
# Strings:
# cwt = "Callia"
# print("Callia" == cwt)

# a = 10/2
# print(5 == a)

# 10>5 (greater than) returns a boolean
# 2<5 (less than) returns a boolean

# >= (greater than or equals) is the same as > or ==
# print(10 > 5) True
# print(5 == 5) True
# a = 4 + 3
# print(6 >= a)

# <= (less than or equals) is the same as < or ==
# a = 4 + 3
# print(7 <= a)

# != (does not equal) this is the opposite of equals (==)
# print('Callia' != 'Jason')

# Quiz
# Wow so exciting!!!

# 1. Correct
# print(5 >= 2)

# 2. Correct
# a = 10
# b = 5 + 5
# print(a <= b)

# 3. Correct
# c = 12
# print(c - 9)

# 4. Correct
# name = 'Jason'
# m = 'ason'
# n = 'J' + m
# print(name == n)

# 5. Correct
# l = 10*3 # 30
# k = 5*6 # 30
# print(k == l)
