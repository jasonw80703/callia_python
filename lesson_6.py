# Indexing to get items from lists
# List: [1, 2, 3, "Callia", "Jason", True, False]
# Create a list with 3 strings

# Get the 2nd item
# print(fruits[1])
# Change the last item to something different
fruits[2] = "orange"
# print(fruits)
# if fruits[0] == "apple":
#   print("THIS IS TRUE")

# if 5 + 5 == 10:

# Today's class: if/else condition

# Real Life Example
# If it is raining today, then I will bring an umbrella. If it is not raining, I will not bring an umbrella.
# If I go to school...
# If 5 + 5 == 10, then I am smart. Else, I am dumb.

# How to check if two things are equal?
# a = 10
# b = 10
# print(a == b)

# What is a condition?
# A condition is what must be true, for something to happen.
# If I have money, I can buy something.

# condition is what comes after the "if"
# if a equals b, then print hello
a = 14
b = 13
# if a == b:
#   print("hello")
